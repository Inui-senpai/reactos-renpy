# reactos-renpy
Port of the ReactOS operating system on Ren'Py. For what? Because I can, of course.

# Long story short
I scroll through the ReactOS page on Twitter in my spare time, and one day I was so inspired by the successful attempts to run this OS on real hardware (and even on a PC-98 emulator called Neko Project) that I even thought to myself, why not port this system to the Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine? Well, after 2 months of hard work, I'm proud to present you this "port".

# Pros
1. You can launch this "port" on an already booted system, whether it be Windows, Linux, or macOS. No virtual machine is required.
2. Practically full OS experience: booting, install, post-install, desktop environment, and much more. Just click on the "Start" ("Начать") button in the main menu.
3. (something else?)

# Cons
1. Currently only Russian language is available. More languages will be available in the near future.
2. Not all OS features are implemented, but I'll update this project occasionally. And you, of course, can help me, if you know the Ren'Py and/or Python language quite well.
3. You can encounter some bugs and exceptions at this moment of time, because this "port" was made initially for Windows.

# How to cook
1. Download the latest version of the Ren'Py SDK: https://www.renpy.org/latest.html
2. Click on the green "Code" and choose "Download ZIP" option
3. Install the downloaded copy of the Ren'Py SDK, then open up its directory and create folder named "reactos_test" (or something like that)
4. Extract the "game" folder from the downloaded ZIP archive into the created folder
5. Launch "renpy.exe"/"renpy-32.exe", "renpy.sh", "renpy.app" (depending on your OS), choose project in Projects list (it will have the same name as the folder from step 3), and click on the Start Project
6. ???
7. PROFIT!!!
